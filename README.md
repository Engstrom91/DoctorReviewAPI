# DoctorReviewAPI
I am very interested in how web applications work and am fascinated by the huge variation of technologies that make up the web. So, of course I wanted to learn about Spring Boot. 
I decided that my first step would be to create a REST service that would simluate a system where patients could rate their doctors for the benefit of the hospital staff. 

# Execution
Please run the program through the DoctorreviewapiApplication class. The default port the application will connect through is 8080. 
You can interact with the dataset through crud commands. The application should work in Eclipse and Spring Tool Suite
but you might not be able to run it in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
